Moutain View High School Visual Arts Deartment Website

I created this website with a partner for Mountain View High School's Visual Arts Department. The structure and some visual design of the site was done by the art teacher we were working with.

Code has been updated since originally writing it to be slightly more modular, and I've added more comments. 

All of the content for the website is being pulled from google sheets that the teacher still has access to, which is how she updates the website. It's quite a roundabout method and makes loading slow, but it was what we ended up going with given the tools/constraints we were working with at the time.
