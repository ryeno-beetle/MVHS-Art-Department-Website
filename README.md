### Moutain View High School Visual Arts Deartment Website

I created this website with a partner for Mountain View High School's Visual Arts Department. The structure and visual design of the site was done working closely with the art teacher we were making the site for, catering specifically to her requests and feedback.

The site was made using React, and it was through this project that my partner and I learned React for the first time. I've changed the code from the original version to be slightly more modular and have better comments. 

All of the content for the website is being pulled from google sheets that the teacher still has access to, which is how she updates the website. It's quite a roundabout method and makes loading slow, but it was what we ended up going with given the tools/constraints we were working with at the time.

The website can be viewed here: https://ryeno-beetle.github.io/MVHS-Art-Department-Website/

Or, the original version is here: https://apps.mvhs.io/arts/
